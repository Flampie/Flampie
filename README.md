- 👋 Hi, I’m @Flampie
- 👀 I’m interested in finding someone to help me with an android app that can do certain functions like uber or bolt. Exept nothing to do with that industry. I believe it will make a killing as no one ever thought of it. Im broke so cant pay the programer but I can assist any way required we can go into business 60/40 when it turns out to be successful ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what i can and im sure ill find someone willing to help me out soon as they will benefit just as much...
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to working with someone trustworthy and ill be in contact with lawyers soon to assist me so that no one tries to steel my idea. ...
- 📫 How to reach me itrepair.train@gmail.com ...
Any advise will be appreciated as to what route to take.
